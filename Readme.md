Developed a comprehensive Supermarket Billing System in Python, featuring user authentication, dynamic inventory management. The system allows users to add new items, remove items, update quantities, and apply discounts. Additionally, it calculates GST and generates detailed receipts, which can be saved for future reference. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python and real-world application development.


Project Description: Supermarket Billing System
Objective:
To develop a supermarket billing system in Python that allows users to manage items, purchase products, and generate detailed receipts, including features like item removal, quantity updates, discounts, and receipt saving.

Features:

Display Items:

Users can view the current list of items available for purchase along with their prices.
Add New Item:

Users can add new items to the inventory by specifying the item name and price. If the item already exists, the system notifies the user.
Purchase Items:

Users can select items to purchase, specify quantities, and view the total price of selected items.
Users can modify their purchase list by removing items or updating quantities before finalizing the bill.
Discounts and GST:

The system calculates GST at a fixed rate of 5% on the total price.
Users can apply discount coupons by entering the discount percentage, which is then deducted from the total price.
Receipt Generation:

A detailed receipt is generated, displaying the purchased items, quantities, individual prices, total amount, GST amount, discount amount (if any), and final amount payable.
Users have the option to save the receipt as a text file.
User-Friendly Interface:

The system provides a clear and interactive menu for users to navigate through different options such as displaying items, adding new items, making purchases, and exiting the program.
